# About the project
## A personal task manager application in React that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application should use the browser's local storage to persist tasks between sessions.
## Task Management: Implement functionality to add new tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
## Persistence: Use local storage to save tasks, ensuring they are available even after the browser is closed and reopened.
## Design a clear and intuitive interface for managing tasks. Include input fields for new tasks and buttons or icons for task management actions.


## Implement basic error handling and input validation to prevent the addition of empty tasks.


## Apply styling to make the application visually appealing and easy to use.
