# About the project
## A personal task manager application in React that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The application should use the browser's local storage to persist tasks between sessions.
### Task Management: Implement functionality to add new tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed or incomplete.
### Persistence: Use local storage to save tasks, ensuring they are available even after the browser is closed and reopened.
